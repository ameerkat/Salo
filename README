#Salo
Salo is the beginning of a framework that allows bots to play a game similar to [Neptune's Pride 2: Triton](http://triton.ironhelmet.com).
## Salo
Salo itsef is the framework that lets the bot act. Salo itself is currently empty.
## Salo Map Generator
Salo map generator generates maps similar to the maps in the game itself, currently only random hex configurations are allowed.
## Salo Simulator
Salo simulator attempts to emulate the workings of the actual game, allowing bots to interact with one another in the same way that humans interact with one another in the actual game. Currently the simulator contains a main game loop, but is lacking methods which allow bots to take actions within the simulator (e.g. purchasing planet upgrades, settings research, diplomatic actions, etc.).
